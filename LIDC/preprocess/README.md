## README

```single_slice``` extract one slice for each nodule, for classifier training

```multiple_slices``` extract multiple slices for each nodule, for auto-encoder training


1. use the ```extract.py``` to extract: whole lung image, bboxs, attributes from LIDC.

   and save them in ```base/raw/``` and ```base/raw.csv```
   
2. use the ```splict.py``` to split train/val/test and generate ```split_mindiam().json```

    you can set min_nod_diameter and ratio (3:1:1) here.

    multiple_slices use the ```split_mindiam().json``` generated by single_slice

3. use the ```jit.py``` to (random) pad and jitter (you can also use ```full_lung.py``` to generate a full lung image w/o random padding and jit)

    and save them in ```base/pad()_jit()_mindiam()_bias()/train,val,test/``` and ```base/pad()_jit()_mindiam()_bias()/annos.csv```

    you can set padsize, jitsize,whether_induce_bias(train only, train,val,test all) here
    
    
#### remarks

1. ```single_slice/trash/jit_left_right_bias.py``` can add the below bias: malignant nodules all on the left side, while benign ones all one the right side. (see Experimental Analysis 0611 Page-3 for the biased performence)
